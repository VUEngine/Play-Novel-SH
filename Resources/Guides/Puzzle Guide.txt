PUZZLE GUIDE

This puzzle guide is simply here to provide the solutions to the few puzzles
contained in Play Novel : Silent Hill for the Gameboy Advance. I am currently
working on a Card Guide and (much slower) on a full translation guide. This
guide is split between Harry and Cybil's puzzles. It is possible to bypass some
of these puzzles. I believe I got all of them since I have the plot line mapped
out, but anything's possible. I just hope the plot line doesn't change
depending on what endings you already have. That's mess up my plot tree for
translation.

==============================[ HARRY'S SCENARIO ]============================

--- SWITCHBOARD PUZZLE -------------------------------- SWITCHBOARD PUZZLE ---
This is a simple "complete the circuit" type puzzle. All you need to do is
click the XXX'd squares with your pointer arrow to complete the switchboard
circuit and move forward in the game.

--- SPECIMEN COLLECTION ------------------------------ SPECIMEN COLLECTION ---
All you have to do is move the magnifying glass over the specimens and press A
to finish the puzzle. It's under the bottom, middle butterfly.


==============================[ CYBIL'S SCENARIO ]============================

--- PHONE NUMBER -------------------------------------------- PHONE NUMBER ---
All you have to do is push the D-Pad to the right when you're at the telephone
screen.

  Phone Number : 38*2647*

--- BLOCK PUZZLE -------------------------------------------- BLOCK PUZZLE ---

Directions:
  Use the D-pad to move the pieces and the R-Trigger to select the pieces to
  move. You want the correct pieces over their corresponding indentions.

Starting position:
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |   |AAA|   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |   |   |BBB|bbb|   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |   |   |ddd|ccc|DDD|   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |   |   |CCC|   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+

You need to match up the AAA, BBB, CCC, and DDD boxes on the aaa, bbb, ccc, and
ddd squares. Once AAA and BBB are in place, placing the CCC and DDD pieces will
move AAA and BBB. All you have to do is use the right trigger to re-select them
and move them.

  +---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |   |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |   |   |AAA|BBB|   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |   |   |DDD|CCC|   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+
  |   |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+---+

Full solution:
  - Move BBB right.
  - Move AAA right.
  - Move AAA down.
  - Move CCC up.
  - Move BBB left.
  - Move DDD down.
  - Move DDD left (x2)
  - Move AAA up.
  - Move CCC right.
  - Move DDD up.
